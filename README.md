# Snowball-Sampling
A simple Python2 module that implements Snowballsampling  with NetworkX

To use it just import these three functions

```Python
    import randomseed from snowballsampling # select a node randomly from a netxork x and return its id
    import snowballsampling from snowballsampling # start the sampling
    import surroundings from snowballsampling # get neighbouring nodes of a a particular node
```
